# Project Otaku

![Demo Image](./docs/demo.png)

[Project Otaku](https://projectotaku.herokuapp.com/) is a web app for creating and managing your
anime and manga list. It uses drag and drop system to manage your list.


## Goal

There are many applications out there like this project but I want something that I can
personalize. I also want to learn how to create web applications using Django with Djano REST
framework and ReactJS.


## Scope

- Users needs an account.
- Users can search an anime/manga.
- Users can add, move, and/or delete an anime/manga in their list.
- Moving an item in the list will use the drag and drop system.


## Additional Note

The project will use the unofficial [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) API called
[Jikan](https://jikan.moe/) API as the main source of anime and manga database.
